## Inspiration ‚ö°
You may be well aware that women in the tech industry are highly underrepresented.1 In fact, only 29% of individuals in the technology field are women.From fresh perspectives to a direct impact on a company‚Äôs bottom line, the importance of women in tech can span far and wide. Here are just a few of the ways that adding women to the IT workforce can help organizations be better equipped to achieve their goals.
Studies from the Credit Suisse Research Institute found that more women in leadership roles increased the likelihood of better financial health for a company, further proving gender diversity is indeed a valuable asset.3

So it‚Äôs no surprise that the study shows that firms who employ women in leadership roles are likelier to have:

A higher return on equity than those who do not.
A higher net income growth rate.
And the findings don‚Äôt stop there. Companies who had women involvement on a board averaged 14% net income growth over the past six years as compared to 10% for the companies with no women board representation.
  

## What is it? üë∏üèª
Phenomenal Women is based on the idea to provide awareness about the programs happens for particularly womens in tech societies.It will help her to get all the things whether its about technical interviews,scholarships,coding sites or articles .

## Challenges I ran into üò∂ 
Being a beginner in software development, I had no experience using Auth0 so. it took too much time and error at first while doing the authentication part. The most challenging thing in this was that I never used hashnode API to fetch the data ,    so it takes lot of time to get that data as I am doing this project solo,So,I dont have anyone to ask none of my friend have also use hashnode API's to get the correct but after some times I tried to do lot of console log search on the google I was able to get that data.
  
## Accomplishments that I am proud of üòé
I was able to overcome all the challenges and was able to create a completely functional prototype. I was able to fetch the data and  I am most proud of the fact that this product will be able to help many people across the globe.
  

## What I learned üë©‚Äçüíª
I learnt how to connect Auth0 with React for authentication,And how to fetch third party API's also I fetched the best articles from Hashnode so that,anyone can get a good reading which has been top at hashnode,by using query I fetched like the coverImage,author,title, brief Introduction,blogHandle and so on.
  
  
## What's next for Phenomenal Women
I decided to add some more resources related to internships as time was very less and I need to complete this soon.
